    "# Using the Portable Antiquities Scheme API\n",

    "This activity is based on the notebook developed by ODAT and script by Daniel Pett [Fitzwilliam Museum](fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk), who designed and built the PAS database and API The original notebook can be found in this forked repository. \n",

    "The [Portable Antiquities Scheme](https://finds.org.uk/about) provides an open access database of finds in support of the Treasury Act. The PAS records finds discovered by the public, outside of excavation, in England and Wales. The data available on the database can be accessed by anyone, but exact findspots are only available to credentialed researchers. The current data consist of almost 1.5 million objects that often contain visual media in the form of photographs, illustrations, or 3D models, as well as linked data. This model of publicâ€“professional collaboration, coupled with an open access dissemination strategy, has proven productive. The PAS lists close to 150 PhD dissertations that have used their data, as well as over 700 total research projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "You've already used Python to connect to the Open Context API, but here we'll use R and try to retrieve data using the PAS API. Since you've already go through the process with using an API, try to notice any similarities or differences between using Python and R. "
