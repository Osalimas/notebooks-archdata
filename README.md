[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/o-date/notebooks-archdata/master)

This binder is preloaded with R, ggplot, Rcurl, ggplot, jsonlite, and the [archdata](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/archdata/archdata.pdf) package. It also has a table from [Graham 2016](https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:18909/) to demonstrate how to read in a csv file. Use this notebook as a starting point for learning some statistical analysis of archaeological data. See also [Marwick 2018 CRAN Taskview: Archaeological Science](https://github.com/benmarwick/ctv-archaeology/).

It also contains a notebook showing how to retrieve information from the [Portable Antiquities Scheme](http://finds.org.uk) database, which could also be analyzed in particular ways. This notebook is in two parts; the first shows how to transform the json search results into a csv. The second uses that data to find the filepaths to download images of the objects into nicely sorted folders. The script is courtesy of Dan Pett, formerly of the PAS and now with the [Fitzwilliam Museum](fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk). Thank you Dan!
