This notebook is preloaded with R, ggplot, and the [archdata](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/archdata/archdata.pdf) package. It also has a table from [Graham 2016](https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:18909/) to demonstrate how to read in a csv file. Use this notebook as a starting point for learning some statistical analysis of archaeological data.
